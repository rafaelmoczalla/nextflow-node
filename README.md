   sudo apt-get install \
   apt-transport-https \
   ca-certificates \
   curl \

   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \

   stable"
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```

Test if docker is working with the following command.

   `sudo docker run hello-world`

To install Docker Compose run the following commands.

   ```bash
   sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.28.5/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
   ```

## Start/Stop/Remove the Cluster
To start the cluster just run the following command in the same folder as the docker-compose file.

   `docker-compose up -d --scale node=3`

To change the number of nodes in the cluster replace 3 by the desired number of nodes.

To stop the cluster run the following command in the same folder as the docker-compose file.

   `docker-compose stop`

To remove a cluster and it's volumes run the following command.

   `docker-compose rm -v`

## Start the Workflow
To start the workflow
1. login into the client node `docker exec -it cluster_client_1 bash` and
2. run the workflow in cluster mode: `nextflow run test.nf -process.executor ignite`

## Building Custom Image for Cluster Nodes
To build your custom image for the cluster nodes modify the `Dockerfile` and build the new image with the following command.

   `docker build -t rafaelmoczalla/nextflow-node:latest .`
